## PIZZA_DELIVERY

This algorithm optimizes the pizza delivery process for a chef based on specific constraints:

- **a)** Adherence to the delivery time for each order is crucial, with a time limit of 30 minutes per delivery.
- **b)** Failure to meet the delivery time requires the chef to provide a 50% discount voucher to the customer for their next order.
- **c)** The pizza chef travels at a speed of 45 km/h in a straight line, simulating a bird's-eye view.
- **d)** The algorithm optimizes the route based on the actual coordinates of each delivery address.
- **e)** The return journey is also optimized to enhance overall efficiency.

### Code Organization

This code will be organized into three Java classes:

1. `DeliveryPerson`
2. `Order`
3. `GPS`
